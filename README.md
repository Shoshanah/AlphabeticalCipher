Determine most alphabetical string (closest to a for all letters) without exceeding given distance.
For a given string and a given distance, return the string that is closest to a for all letters, where proximity is defined by how many letters away the given string is from the corresponding letter in the result string.
Rollover is supported to help reduce distance at either end of the alphabet: after z, a is 1 away. By the same logic, in the other direction before a, z is one away.
